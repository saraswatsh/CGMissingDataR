CGMissingDataR is an R package based on the CGMissingData Python library for evaluating model performance under feature missingness by: 

* injecting missing values into feature columns at specified masking rates, 
* imputing missing values using a Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)-style iterative imputer, and
* training Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors regressors to report Mean ABsolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R across missingness levels. 

Before the installation, ensure that you have the following R packages installed: 

```r
install.packages(c("FNN", "ranger", "mice"))
```
Install the development version of CGMissingDataR from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("saraswatsh/CGMissingDataR")
```
Install `CGMissingDataR`from CRAN with: 

```r
install.packages("CGMissingDataR")
```
