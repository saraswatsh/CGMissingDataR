# CGMissingDataR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CGMissingDataR is an R package wrapping the CGMissingData Python library for evaluating model performance under feature missingness by: 

* injecting missing values into feature columns at specified masking rates, 
* imputing missing values using a Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)-style iterative imputer, and
* training Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors regressors to report Mean ABsolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R across missingness levels. 

## Installation

R Prerequisites:

```r
install.packages("reticulate")
```
Install the development version of CGMissingDataR from GitHub:
